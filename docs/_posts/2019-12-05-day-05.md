Well, well, well... I wasn't expecting it to come back *this* soon, but I did call it.
In hindsight it wasn't that hard to predict, but come on, give me something.

Now, I still think that it might come back for yet another round. I can't think of anything in terms of operations that could be added to extend the puzzle, but it might be a repeat of the infamous day 19. I don't know if you've noticed, but that puzzle really seemed to have an effect on me.

I didn't bother extending the code from day 2. Instead, I went with a more sophisticated, slightly more modular approach. I missed the chance to extract the "operation logic" into a trait implemented by the various instructions and reused the ol' [match approach](https://github.com/siku2/aoc_2019/blob/64ae98984cdbee95b4ad98bff5440cf7d9f67990/src/puzzles/day_05.rs#L75), but hey, life is too short to worry about these things *too* much.

> Sighs, I should really start using traits for this...

Apart from the few extra instructions, this wasn't all that different from the first one (on day 2), so I don't have anything interesting to say about it.
I really liked the addition of an IO system though.

I spent most of the time working on the new "calendar" overview though. It's really cheap, but I kinda like it so I'm going to keep it for now.

Here's a screenshot of the previous menu:

I also added the link to the source code at the top.
