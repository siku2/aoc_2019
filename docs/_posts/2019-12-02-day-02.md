title:  "Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm"
---

I really enjoy writing "emulators" or even just small language interpreters to solve puzzles, however, I'm a tad wary that this Intcode program is going to come back again soon.
To be clear, I wouldn't mind if it came back, but last year there was a similar puzzle on [day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/19) which had a let's say problematic second part. The code used a very inefficient implementation and had to be translated to find out what it did ([See my solution](https://github.com/siku2/AoC2018/blob/master/src/puzzles/day19.rs)).
I honestly quite enjoyed that puzzle, but somehow it irked me that the problem couldn't be solved using programming only and with today's puzzle I think we might be seeing something similar again this year.  

I rewrote some of the input logic which meant I had to adjust parts of day 1. I also decided to add some unit tests, but the second part can't really be tested.
