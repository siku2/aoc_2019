title:  "Advent of Code 2019"
---

Well here we are again, a year has passed and I haven't used Rust since last year's Advent of Code... "So", I thought, "let's just do it again this year" and that's why it's Rust again.

Please take note that I actively avoided making the "you could say my Rust skills have gotten **rust**y" joke, so I could write this note and ruin it.

I had actually planned to try to get on the leaderboard this year, but well, I would have to solve the puzzles at 6am, which is currently 2 hours away from when I fall asleep.
I'm just not that competitve to do that to myself. And hey, this way I can always claim that I *certainly* would've made it, had I tried :P
